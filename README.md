# Square searcher

This is just a simple Wolfram Mathematica project, which finds magic squares in English. Magic square is such a table of letters, whose rows and columns are words.

This program also searches for Sator-Arepo squares (see [Sator Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square)).
